# Major project To-Do list (12/19/2019)

## To do
- player and map collision (player kept out of grid)
- spawn location for player and entities 
- custom class stats 
- map navigation (being able to move across the diffrent maps)
- combat system, attacking and range for enemies [when they begin moving towards you (thinking 8 -10 cells distance)]
