# Reflection

## Challenges
- I struggled with collision detection, trying to keep the player out of the grid 
- I struggled with level changing for quite a while aswell.
- In addition I also struggled creating an AI for the enemy.
## Solutions 
- To solve my collision issue, after 2 weeks I eventually decided it'd be better to put the player in the grid, as I already wasted alot of time.
- I never fully solved the level swap issue, when you walk up to the stairs it will switch levels however you are unable to move (no idea why, movement is done with the keyPressed function so it should work) and for some reason the stairs have about a 40% chance to run an error
- I fiddled around for a couple days and ended up with a very terrible AI, however it does work. It's just really dumb and gets caught on things
## What would I do diffrently?
- I started off over ambitious, coming up with tons of ideas, which quite a few were beyond my programming capability.
- To start I wouldn't of wasted all my time with the collision detection and would of just started with putting the player in the grid.
- With the time saved from that I would've been able to do the enemies much more elegantly, using a array and class but just ran out of time and figured I should atleast have something on the final product.
- With the time saved I believe I could've also changed the player attacks so the wizard and ranger were actually ranged instead of melee.

## Meet proposal.md
- I managed to meet all the need to haves and a couple of the nice to haves. (see proposal.md, things are labeled with "Done")
