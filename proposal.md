# Major Project Proposal

- Health and Damage system
- Enemies
- Sound effects (buttons, attacks and background)
- Leveling system (Ability to progress and improve stats) (Done)
- Items (armor, weapons, consumables) (Done)

## Nice to have list 
- Appealing graphics (levels, enemies, chests, etc.) (Done)
- Diffrent Classes (2-4 (Archer, Warrior, Mage, ?? )) (Done)
- Mana points (depending if classes get added)
- Inventory (abilty to store consumables and items in a grid)
- Class specific abilities (depending if classes get added)
- Boss fight
- Mini games
- Money system (selling items, gold from killing enemies)
- Skill tree (increase damage, defense, health, etc)
