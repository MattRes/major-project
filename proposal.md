# Major Project Proposal

## Description
I'm going to make an RPG game, where one can explore diffrent rooms/levels. They will encounter diffrent enemies as they progress and find improved loot. As they progress through diffrent rooms, overcoming enemies they will gain levels. 


## Need to have list
- Playable character 
- Multiple rooms/levels (where the player will encounter chests, items and enemies)
- Inventory (abilty to store consumables and items in a grid)
- Health and Damage system
- Enemies
- Sound effects (buttons, attacks and background)
- Leveling system (Ability to progress and improve stats)
- Items (armor, weapons, consumables) 

## Nice to have list 
- Appealing graphics (levels, enemies, chests, etc.)
- Diffrent Classes (2-4 (Archer, Warrior, Mage, ?? ))
- Mana points (depending if classes get added)
- Class specific abilities (depending if classes get added)
- Boss fight
- Mini games
- Money system (selling items, gold from killing enemies)
- Skill tree (increase damage, defense, health, etc)
